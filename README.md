# Instructions

## Create the environment variables

You will need to create two .env files for your project: .env.test and .env.development.
Into each, add [PGDATABASE=<database_name_here>](PGDATABASE=<database_name_here>), with the correct database name for that environment.
You may refer to /db/setup.sql for the database names.
**Double check that these .env files are .gitignored.**
